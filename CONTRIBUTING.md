Pull Request Guidelines
=======================

TridentSDK/Trident is a Minecraft server implementation that is community-driven, extensive and multi-threaded. This software complies with Mojang’s end users license agreement (EULA) for Minecraft.
The executable/compiled file of Trident/TridentSDK will be available to the public [here](http://example.com/) for free download. As said before, we're a community-driven project and wish to see interactions and contributions from the community.
A great way to-do so is PRs, doing so we need to set some documentation over what is required for us to accept your PR. So, this is generally it.

Keep in mind that you will be asked before accepting your PR if you agree to our [Contributors TOS](#terms-and-conditions-for-contributors).

## Getting Started
- You will first need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free);
- You will require to have an account on [TridentSDK](http://example.com/);
- Reported the issue on our [issue-tracker and support](http://example.com/);
- Have a fork of the repository.

## Making the Changes
* Create a branch on your fork where you'll be making your changes;
    * Name your branch something relevant to the change you are looking to make
    * Note: if your changes affect both TridentSDK and Trident, it is highly suggested you use the same branch name on both repos.
    * To create a branch in Git;
        * `git branch relevantBranchName`
        * Then checkout the new branch with `git checkout relevantBranchName`
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing;
* Make sure your code meets [our requirements](#code-requirements);
* Make sure your commit messages are in the [proper format](#commit-message-example);
* Test your changes to make sure it actually addresses the issue it should;
* Make sure your code compiles under Java 7, as that is what the project has to be built with. We will not be supporting Java 8 within the near future.

## Code Requirements
* We strictly follow the [Sun/Oracle coding conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html) as we're on open-source project.

* No tabs; use 4 spaces instead.

* No trailing whitespaces.

* No CRL+F line endings, LF only, set your Gits 'core.autocrlf' to 'true'.

    These whitespace requirements are easily and often overlooked.  They are critical formatting requirements designed to help simplify a shared heterogeneous development environment.  Learn how your IDE functions in order to show you these characters and verify them.  Analyse the git diff closely to verify every character and if the PR should include the character change.  It is tedious and it is critical.

* No 80 column limit or 'weird' mid-statement newlines.

* Any major additions should have documentation ready and provided if applicable (this is usually the case).

* All PRs must be associated with an issue-tracker id, however one may be created for you if PR follows other requirements and guidelines.

* There needs to be a new line at the end of every file.

* PRs with JavaDocs comments already made will help us accept and understand your PR.

* Your PR must follow the PR format set out once creating one, any which doesn't follow said format will automatically be rejected.

* Your commits should follow the [general format](#commit-message-format).

* Any PRs that are racist and/or offensive to anyone through commit messages or code-comments will be rejected immediately and reported to GitHub. We have 0 tolerance for any type of offensive content.

### Commit Message Format
>   Provide an example commit for CONTRIBUTING.md. Fixes TRIDENT-1
>
> The CONTRIBUTING.md is missing an example commit message.  Without this
> commit, we are unable to provide potential contributors with a helpful example,
> forcing developers to guess at what an acceptable commit message would look
> like. This commit fixes this issue by providing a clear and informative example
> for contributors to base their work off of.
