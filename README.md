TridentSDK
=========

The TridentSDK is a new development API which can be used to develop plugins for the popular game Minecraft. Since the EULA has caused many services to start dying/shutting down Trident was developed to evade this. It reflects the MinecraftAPI so that it is not using Mojangs code at all. Therefore it evades the EULA meaning it can be a sutainable and effective EULA evading option for developers.
